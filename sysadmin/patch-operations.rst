OpenShift Patch Operations
--------------------------

``oc patch`` is currently not documented in the official OpenShift documentation.
However since ``oc`` is an enhanced Kubernetes client ``kubectl`` the following
Kubernetes documentation applies:

* `kubectl patch <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_patch/>`_
* `PATCH operations <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/devel/api-conventions.md#patch-operations>`_
