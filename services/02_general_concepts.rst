.. TODO: explain our Vagrant box

You can build this box using the Vagrantfile in the ``docs_vagrant`` repository (make sure to adjust the path to your repositories in the Vagrantfile). If you are not familiar with Vagrant please refer to the official documentation at #2.

After you have successfully built our Vagrant box and started it using ``vagrant up``, open an SSH connection using ``vagrant ssh``. Change into the directory for ``docs_webserver`` and you are ready to go.
